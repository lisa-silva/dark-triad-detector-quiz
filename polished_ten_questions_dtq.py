    "Charm Overload: Does he charm everyone instantlyâ€”friends, strangers, even serversâ€”so your complaints about him sound unbelievable?",
    "Sudden Absence: Does he vanish for days without a word, leaving you checking his status while he acts like nothing happened?",
    "Jealousy Flip: Does he accuse you of cheating or flirting while heâ€™s the one hiding texts or dodging questions?",
    "Gift Guilt: Does he give small favors or cash, then act like you owe him your loyalty forever?",
    "Public Praise, Private Sting: Does he praise you in front of others but criticize you harshly when youâ€™re alone?",
    "Gaslight Twist: Does he call you too sensitive or say you misremember events, making you question your own reality?",
    "Isolation Web: Does he make you feel watched everywhereâ€”stores, parks, socialsâ€”so you avoid going out to escape his judgment?",
    "Ambition Block: Does he mock your goals or hobbies, turning your progress into proof youâ€™re neglecting him?",
    "Blame Shift: Does he claim youâ€™re the one hurting him, even when youâ€™ve done nothing but try to please him?",
    "Control Probe: Does he ask about your day or friends, only to use your answers later as ammo to control or shame you?"
